#Brackets-Base-Code
Base Code is an extension for [brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets). Base Code aims to provide a similar functionality that DreamWeaver has in which the 'base HTML code' is automatically inserted into your file.

Credit for everything here goes to Colt Fortenberry.

#Installation
To use Base Code simply open Brackets and go to the Extensions Manager (File->Extensions Manager). Search for Base Code Insert and install the plugin.

#Usage
To insert the base HTML code into the file simple use the key combination Ctrl+Shift+I or use the option in the IntelliJ menu. (IntelliJ->Insert Base Code)
